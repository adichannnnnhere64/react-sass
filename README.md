# Laravel JJetstream React (Typescript) Starter Kit

## Introduction

A React starter kit based on Laravel Jetstream which provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a React frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page React applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of React combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This React starter kit utilizes React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/) component library.

## Getting Started

```bash
laravel new --using=adrum/laravel-react-mantine-starter-kit
```

## Documentation

Documentation for Official Laravel starter kits can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits). This project is not an official Laravel starter kit, but most of the documentation for the React starter kit should apply to this project as well.

## License

The Laravel + React (Mantine) starter kit is open-sourced software licensed under the MIT license.
